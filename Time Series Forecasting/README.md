Welcome!

In this project I forecast average daily temperature in Delhi 30 days into the future. For predicting I'm using NeuralProphet
a powerful tool for explainable times series forecasting. I explore usefulness of particular NeuralProphet components, such as trend and lagged observations regression,
for prediction accuracy.

Main goal of this project was to show my familiarity of NeuralProphet and Time Series Forecasting nuances.
