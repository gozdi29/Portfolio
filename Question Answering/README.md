Welcome!

In this project I fine-tuned different pretrained Transformers-based models to do extractive question answering, which means 
that given a passage and question regarding that passage, a part of the passage is returned as an answer.

My goal for this project was to show my knowledge of different architectures available in Transformers library and my ability of fine-tuning them to do Question Answering
